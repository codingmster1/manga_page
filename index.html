<h4><em>From Dark Horse:His name is Guts, the Black Swordsman, a feared warrior spoken of only in 
whispers. Bearer of a gigantic sword, an iron hand, and the scars of countless battles and tortures, 
his flesh is also indelibly marked with The Brand, an unholy symbol that draws the forces of darkness 
to him and dooms him as their sacrifice. But Guts won't take his fate lying down; he'll cut a crimson 
swath of carnage through the ranks of the damned â€” and anyone else foolish enough to oppose him! </h4>
