<h4>We, and Berserk fans alike, have long awaited the return of the black swordsman and the
    hiatus is finally over. Koji Mori, Miura's close friend, will be writing, while his Assistants
    are responsible for the artwork, the rest of the series as they talked in private, years prior,
    on how the series would end and the chapters that would come before. If anyone can continue 
    this amazing series, these two groups are the best ones for the job. 
</h4>
<h4><em><strong>From Dark Horse Comics and Mangaka Kentaro Miura: His name is Guts, the Black Swordsman, a feared warrior spoken of only in 
whispers. Bearer of a gigantic sword, an iron hand, and the scars of countless battles and tortures, 
his flesh is also indelibly marked with The Brand, an unholy symbol that draws the forces of darkness 
to him and dooms him as their sacrifice. But Guts won't take his fate lying down; he'll cut a crimson 
swath of carnage through the ranks of the damned â€” and anyone else foolish enough to oppose him!</strong> </h4>

<h4>Despite the death of Kentaro Miura, Berserk will not remain unfinished. The author's 
masterpiece, one of the most influential seinen in history, will be resumed soon by Kouji Mori, mangaka 
and close friend of Kentaro Miura. Berserk, and manga fans alike, once lost hope the series
would ever continue and believing it would pass with Miura himself. One year later, it's 
been confirmed we will see an end to the story of the struggling swordsman, and before that, his journey towards his goal.
RIP Miura, we will never forget you.</h4>
